# Week 0 - Where Is My `<BOS>` Token?

> Weekly Decoding is a collection of writings recording the decoding phase of my life decoder until `<EOS>` token is present. Every Sunday night, I take one step ahead and share my inputs with the world.

1. Focus on developing the [Slurm agent](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/pull/3005) with amazing engineers from [Union.ai](https://www.union.ai/)
2. Deploy [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) on a server with a single Nvidia V100 GPU card
3. Create a high-level diagram of the GPU server network topology in my company
4. Attend the weekly ML infra meeeting
5. Run 3km twice
6. Have dinner with my mom and dad

This is just my first decoding step, and I haven't had time to sort out my context yet. More to come next week--stay tuned!
