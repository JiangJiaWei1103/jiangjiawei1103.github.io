# Week 1 - Slow and Steady Wins the Race

> Weekly Decoding is a collection of writings recording the decoding phase of my life decoder until `<EOS>` token is present. Every Sunday night, I take one step ahead and share my inputs with the world.

1. Deliver the [Slurm agent](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/pull/3005) v1 and sync the next steps
2. (WIP) Automate the LLM import pipeline to reduce manual operations
    * Firewalls remain a challenge 
3. Participate in the tech talk held by [opensource4you](https://www.facebook.com/opensource4you)
4. Run 3km twice, 2.3km once, and workout once
    * Fail to run 3km once because I cannot maintain the pace

## Inputs
### [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#courtesy) 
\- by Eric Steven Raymond, `#article`

> Don't be the one merely passively demanding knowledge from others.

Since joining an open-source community, I have often pondered the best (or at least a better) way to ask questions. I understand that no one is obligated to answer my questions, and I worry about being a *time sink* of others. However, I didn’t know how to combat this anxiety until I came across this article.

I summarize some of the most inspiring parts below without delving too deeply into the details-—after all, different readers may interpret the same content differently.

1. Demonstrate that I can learn from the answers
2. Contribute to the community’s collective experience to create a win-win situation
3. Be precise--volume is not precision
<!-- > Describe the goal, not the step -->
<!-- top-down, narrow down the room for imagination -->

With the above essentials in mind, I am currently practicing the following actionable items:

1. Formalize a question in the format: "\<object\> - \<deviation\>"
2. Tell raw symptoms, not surmises
3. Ensure reproducibility before reporting a bug
4. Generate a minimal test case as small as possible

This article is worth reflecting on and I highly recommend that you give it a read. Also, I would like to read [this](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) in the near future!

I apologize for the late update, as I have been busy planning to pursue a second master’s degree in the U.S. in 2027. My experience as an exchange student in Aachen, Germany, during 2023/24 was the germ that sparked my interest in studying abroad. The real turning point came when I met [opensource4you](https://www.facebook.com/opensource4you), which was truly mind-blowing. A big shout-out to Chia-Ping, Kevin, Han-Ru, Yee, Kai-Hsun, Nary, and so many others. While you might not see this now, I appreciate all your kindness and support from the bottom of my heart.

Happy Chinese New Year!
