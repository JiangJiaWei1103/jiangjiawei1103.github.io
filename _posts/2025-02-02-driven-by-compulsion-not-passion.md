# Week 2 - Driven by Compulsion, Not Passion

> Weekly Decoding is a collection of writings recording the decoding phase of my life decoder until `<EOS>` token is present. Every Sunday night, I take one step ahead and share my inputs with the world.

I have been celebrating Chinese New Year with my family this week. Following are some updates:
1. Write some tests for [migrating from `container_image` to `image`](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/pull/3094) to improve UX
2. Take K8s courses on Udemy:
    * Complete [Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners - Hands-on](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-kubernetes/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW)
    * (WIP) Take [Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW)

> If you want to excel at something, you must do it as a compulsion.

I often wonder what drives someone to persist in a particular pursuit, such as building one’s skill set. In addition, I question whether passion can truly fuel motivation. What I observe is that passion remains susceptible to fluctuations, like moments of fatigue, burnout, or the trivialities of daily life. As a result, demotivation can often become a wild card when you base your motivation on passion.

On the other hand, compulsion is different. It is an uncontrollable drive—an extreme force—that can make someone behave like an addict. Just like an addict, one can keep going regardless of motivation. I still vividly remember how I became addicted to Kaggle competitions when I was a first-year master’s student. Opening the Kaggle webpage symbolized the start of my day. However, I struggled to pinpoint exactly what I was addicted to. Was it the Kaggle platform, data science itself, or simply the feeling of being competitive?

Now, I no longer actively participate in Kaggle competitions, though I occasionally check out interesting ones. Clearly, compulsion can persist for a while (nearly one and a half years for me), but it can also disappear or transform. Can I find a permanent compulsion until my `<EOS>` token is present? I don’t have an answer to that yet.
