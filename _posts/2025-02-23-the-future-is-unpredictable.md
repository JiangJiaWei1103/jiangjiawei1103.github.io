# Week 4 & 5 - The Future Is Unpredictable

> Weekly Decoding is a collection of writings recording the decoding phase of my life decoder until `<EOS>` token is present. Every Sunday night, I take one step ahead and share my inputs with the world.

1. Keep refining [Flyte Slurm agent](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/pull/3005)
    * So excited to announce that the [`SlurmFunctionTask`](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/pull/3150) has been merged
2. Design a naive GitLab CI pipeline that scans hard-coded values in a specified code snippet
    * Just use `curl` to send a request to the Ollama server--nothing special
3. Transition to a new team, focusing on improving the stability and efficiency of LLM model serving
    * Currently still participating in the on-call rotation for my previous team
4. Attend the weekly ML infra meeeting and participate in the tech talk held by [opensource4you](https://www.facebook.com/opensource4you)
5. Run 3km twice, workout once, and play basketball with my friends once in week 4
6. Run 3km twice and workout once in week 5

### N/A

> Increase the number of choices available for my future self.

I get stuck and don't have any tools or strategies to break free. This is probably the most persistent feeling I’ve been experiencing recently. *No plan, no direction, not even a goal*--that's how my life looks when I'm writing it down.

The future is truly unpredictable, especially in this post-AI hype era. Therefore, trying to devise the perfect long-term strategy and relentlessly sticking to it feels impractical. What keeps me grounded in this fast-changing environment is the number of choices my future self will have. But how? How can I equip myself with the right skill set to adapt to constant change? I don’t expect to have an answer now or even in the near future.

However, the real jailbreak is realizing that I have a choice--a choice to rediscover myself, to interpret the world from different perspectives through continuous exploration, and to find resonance with it.

I’ll keep refining my thoughts and discussing this topic in future posts.
