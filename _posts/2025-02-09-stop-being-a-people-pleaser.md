# Week 3 - Stop Being a People Pleaser

> Weekly Decoding is a collection of writings recording the decoding phase of my life decoder until `<EOS>` token is present. Every Sunday night, I take one step ahead and share my inputs with the world.

I've struggled to stick to my schedule this week. Here’s a summary of what I managed to complete:
1. Complete the [documentation](https://flyte--6231.org.readthedocs.build/en/6231/deployment/agents/slurm.html) of setting up an environment to test Flyte Slurm agent locally
2. Automate the LLM import pipeline, reducing the manual operations from three to one
    * (WIP) Researching the design of a unified model registry
3. Run 3km twice and workout once--but for a much shorter duration than planned

> Be so good they can't ignore you.

I plan to continue reading this series next week and summarize it as a whole—there’s a lot to ruminate on.
